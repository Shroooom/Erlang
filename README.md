--HW2 for ProgLang--

In this homework we implement a peer-to-peer system consisting of a directory and multiple file servers. The Directory Service keeps track of the files located in the File Servers. A client can interact with the Directory Service to upload files—which the Directory Service decomposes into parts and distributes among the File Servers,—or to request information on a file so the Client may download the file parts directly from the File Servers to reconstruct the file locally.
